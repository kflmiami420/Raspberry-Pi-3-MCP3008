# Raspberry-Pi-3-mcp3008-Analog-to-Digital-converter
Raspberry Pi 3 and MCP3008 Analog to Digital Converter .   Used to convert Analog signal from Adafruit 1733 Anemometer to a digital Signal. 

My project is using an MCP3008 to get the voltage signal from an Adafruit 1733 Anemometer to be able to be used by a raspberry pi 3 with python 

Second phase of the project will also grab the signal from a wind direction guage (if analog unit is used )

Third phase of the project will also grab te signal from a rain gauge (if analog unit is used )
